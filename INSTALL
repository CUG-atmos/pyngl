To build and install PyNGL, type;

   python setup.py install

This installation assumes that you have NCAR Graphics files (like
fontcaps, databases, ctrans, med) installed to $NCARG_ROOT/{bin,lib}.

By default, the "pynglex" script and example *.py files will get
copied from the "examples" directory in this directory. This means if
you have extraneous files in this directory, they may get installed
too. (Files like "Makefile" and "yMakefile" will not get installed.)

To avoid this, you can force the setup.py file to get a clean copy
of the example scripts by doing a "cvs co". To get setup.py to do this,
setenv USE_CVS to 1.

To just build the _hlu.so file and not install anything, type:

   python setup.py build_ext

If you need to include additional system library paths, like "/sw/lib"
for MacOSX, then you can add this library to the "ncl_and_sys_libs"
variable in setup.py, or you can type:

  python setup.py build_ext -L/sw/lib

There are other things you can include on the line like this. For
more information, type:

  python setup.py build_ext --help
