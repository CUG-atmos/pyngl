PyNGL ("pingle") stands for "Python NCL Graphics Library" and is a
Python package for producing publication-quality 2D visualizations.

Nio is a Python module that allows read and/or write access to a
variety of data formats (netCDF, GRIB1, HDF4, HDF-EOS2, CCM History
tape) using an interface modelled on netCDF.  This module is part of
the PyNGL version 0.1.1b8

The 2D visualizations can be drawn on an X11 window or saved as as
PostScript, PDF, or NCGM file.

Interfaces exist for the rapid display of:

    Contour plots
    XY plots
    World map projections
    Vector plots
    Streamline plots
    Output primitives (lines, markers, polygons, text)

In order to run PyNGL, you must have Numeric installed, and optionally
ScientificPython (for running some of the examples that open netCDF
files).

The documentation contains line-by-line explanations of PyNGL scripts.

Bug reports and feedback are appreciated (see email addresses below).

Installation:
-------------

Required: Python 2.3 or higher and Numeric 23.1 or higher.  Earlier or
later versions of these packages may work, but we haven't tested all
of them.

Installation is simple:

    python setup.py install

(the second command requires root privileges on many installations).


Examples:
---------

To run a PyNGL example, type:

   pynglex ngl01p

This will generate a PostScript file called "ngl01p.ps" containing XY
plots.

For a complete list of PyNGL examples, type:

   pynglex -a
