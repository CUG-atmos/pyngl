PyNGL ("pingle") stands for "Python NCL Graphics Library" and is a
Python package for producing publication-quality 2D visualizations.

PyNGL is available with NumPy support only (Numeric support was
dropped October 2007).  You can import this package with:

import Ngl

These binaries were built against Python 2.5.x, Python 2.4.4, and 
NumPy 1.x.

The visualizations can be drawn on an X11 window or saved as
PostScript, PDF, or NCGM files.

Interfaces exist for the rapid display of:

    Contour plots
    XY plots
    World map projections
    Vector plots
    Streamline plots
    Output primitives (lines, markers, polygons, text)

Installation:
-------------

Required: Python 2.4 or higher and NumPy version 1.0 or higher.
Earlier or later versions of these packages may work, but we haven't
tested all of them.

Binary installation is simple:

    python setup.py install

This command may require root privileges on some systems.

Source code installation is not trivial. See the INSTALL file
in this directory.

Examples:
---------

To run a PyNGL example, type:

   pynglex ngl01p

This command will generate a PostScript file called "ngl01p.ps"
containing XY plots.

To have the example generate an X11 window instead of a PostScript
file, type:

   pynglex -w x11 ngl01p

For a PDF file:

   pynglex -w pdf ngl01p

For a complete list of PyNGL examples, type:

   pynglex -l
