PyNGL ("pingle") stands for "Python NCL Graphics Library" and is a
Python package for producing publication-quality two-dimensional
visualizations.

Use of this software implies agreement of the PyNGL source code
license:

  http://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Licenses/PyNGL_source_license.shtml

You can import this package with:

  import Ngl

PyNGL is available with NumPy support only.  (Numeric support was
dropped October 2007.)

PyNGL has been tested against Python 2.5.x, Python 2.4.x, and NumPy
1.x.

The visualizations can be drawn on an X11 window or saved as
PostScript, PDF, or NCGM files.

Interfaces exist for the rapid display of:

    Contour plots
    XY plots
    World map projections
    Vector plots
    Streamline plots
    Output primitives (lines, markers, polygons, text)

Installation:
-------------

Required: Python 2.4 or higher and NumPy version 1.0 or higher.
Earlier or later versions of these packages may work, but we haven't
tested all of them.

Binary installation is simple:

    python setup.py install

This command may require root privileges on some systems.

Source code installation is not trivial. See the INSTALL file in this
directory.

Examples:
---------

Many PyNGL examples depend on PyNIO, which used to be packaged with
PyNGL. PyNIO is now a separate package, but can be downloaded from the
same location as PyNGL.  See http://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/download.shtml

To run a PyNGL example (that doesn't depend on PyNIO), type:

   pynglex ngl01p

This command will generate a multi-page PostScript file called
"ngl01p.ps" containing several XY plots.

To have this example generate an X11 window instead of a PostScript
file, type:

   pynglex -w x11 ngl01p

You will need to click on the X11 window with your left mouse button to
advance to the next page (frame).

For a PDF file:

   pynglex -w pdf ngl01p

For a complete list of PyNGL examples, type:

   pynglex -l
