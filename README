PyNGL ("pingle") stands for "Python NCL Graphics Library" and is a
Python package developed at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research for producing publication-quality two-dimensional
visualizations. It is based on the same graphical libraries
that the NCAR Command Language (NCL) uses.

Use of this software implies agreement of the PyNGL source code
license:

You can import this package with:

  import Ngl

PyNGL 1.5.0 was tested against Python 2.7.12 and NumPy 1.11.2, but
should be compatible with other Python 2.7 and NumPy 1.9+ versions.
It can only be built against NCL versions 6.1.0 and higher; we highly
recommend NCL version 6.3.0 or higher.

PyNGL 1.4.0 was tested against Python 2.6.x and Python 2.7.x, NumPy
1.5.1, and NumPy 1.6.0. PyNGL 1.4.0 and later can only be built
against NCL version 6.0.0 (not 6.1.0 or later).

PyNGL 1.3.1 was tested against Python 2.6.x and Python 2.5.x, NumPy
1.3.0, and NumPy 1.4.1. PyNGL 1.3.1 and earlier can only be built
against NCL versions 5.2.1 and earlier.

The visualizations can be drawn on an X11 window or saved as PNG, SVG,
PostScript, PDF, or NCGM files.

Interfaces exist for the rapid display of:

    Contour plots
    XY plots
    World map projections
    Vector plots
    Streamline plots
    Output primitives (lines, markers, polygons, text)
